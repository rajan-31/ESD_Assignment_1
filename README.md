# ESD Assignment 1

### Problem Statement

Build a static e-commerce web application featuring the following pages, using HTML, basic CSS, and Bootstrap to structure and style the layout.

### Instructions

1. For this assignment, create simple and straightforward static website pages to build a foundational understanding of core web concepts.There is no need to build the functionality (Javascript not required). Only the visual aspect of the web page has to be developed.
2. Focus on replicating the layout and design of the images provided below.
3. As far as possible, make use of Bootstrap containers and other Bootstrap components (like navbar, form-control, flexbox, Buttons, etc). It's ok if custom HTML/CSS is used instead of Bootstrap. But Bootstrap makes life easy.
4. Utilize the Learning Resources to implement Bootstrap components and layout techniques effectively across each page. 

### For submission

- Upload a zip file, containing all the files.
- Provide your Github public repo link also, make sure its a public repo, repo link is valid, and your commit message make sense, as it may be checked during final your "VIVA".
